# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Production image for deployment to Eshobe CMS.
#
# The theme is Next.js `output: 'standalone'`: the server bundle is traced into
# `.next/standalone`, and `scripts/prepare-standalone.mjs` places `.next/static` and
# `public/` beside it. The runtime stage copies exactly that prepared directory — one
# image layer owns the server, its traced node_modules, the static chunks and the fonts.
#
# Everything the platform injects (`ESHOBE_CMS_URL`, `ESHOBE_API_KEY`, …) stays a
# **runtime** variable: nothing here bakes a tenant, a key or an origin into the image.
#
# QA fixture media (`public/qa/`) is deliberately excluded: `prepare:standalone` filters
# it unless `ARCH2_INCLUDE_QA=1`, and this image never sets that.
